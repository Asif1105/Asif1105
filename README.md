Welcome to my repository ! <br/>
You've come to the right place ...


# **About Me**
I'm an Innovative UI Architect | Crafting Digital Excellence from India. For over a decade I had many opportunities to work in a vast spectrum of web technologies what let me gather a significant amount of various experience. Working for companies and individuals around the globe I met and learnt from amazing and ambitious people. I create successful responsive websites that are fast, easy to use, and built with best practices.

When it comes to business, first impressions matter, and good website design is the key to capitalizing on them. An excellent site is not judged solely on its looks, but on its functionality and usability as well. My experience as a programmer allows me to come up with intelligent solutions to technical challenges, while at the same time designing sleek and visually appealing websites. Aside from having extensive knowledge of recognized technical standards, I am conversant with modern building practices.


# **My Areas of Interest**
My Core Competencies are JavaScript, TypeScript, React and Node, building small and medium web/mobile apps, custom plugins, features, animations, and coding interactive layouts.
In building applications, I'm equipped with just the right tools, and can absolutely function independently of them to deliver fast, resilient solutions optimized to scale as performance and scalabilty are priorities on my radar.
