# Asif Buhari
Welcome to my repository ! <br/>
You've come to the right place ...


# **About Me**
I'm a front-end developer who is enthusiastic in developing clean and elegant sites/apps for the past 10+ years.


# **My Areas of Interest**
The main area of my expertise is HTML, CSS, JS, TS, building small and medium web/mobile apps, custom plugins, 
features, animations, and coding interactive layouts.
In building JavaScript applications, I'm equipped with just the right tools, and can absolutely function 
independently of them to deliver fast, resilient solutions optimized for scale â€” performance and scalabilty are priorities on my radar.
